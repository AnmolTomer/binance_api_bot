# TaLib and Historical Data Processing

- We will start working with talib package, process the candlestick files, running them through talib indicators and see other packages for technical analysis.

- Install `ta-lib` using `pip install ta-lib`. TA-Lib is written in C/C++ and there is a python wrapper around it, which allows us to use the same methods. It helps us to detect various candlestick patterns etc. Installation instructions can be found [here](http://mrjbq7.github.io/ta-lib/install.html)
